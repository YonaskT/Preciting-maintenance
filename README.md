The goal of the project is to help prevent unplanned downtime by predicting failures before they occur.

The idea is to develop a classification model that predicts the likelihood of a machine failure based on variables like air temperature, process temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear.

The data set for this project is available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/601/ai4i+2020+predictive+maintenance+dataset).
